## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Software Engineer**  
Crimsonlake Technologies, Hyderabad  
*Mar 2024 – Mar 2025*

- Developed casino games that handle around 1.5 million bets per day, ensuring high scalability, reliability, and seamless user experience under heavy load.
- Identified and resolved a critical memory retention issue in a Java-based system that caused pods to scale up without scaling down, leading to unnecessary resource consumption. Post-fix, the system optimized resource usage, reducing infrastructure costs and improving overall scalability and efficiency.
- Developed an automated feed application that generates fancy markets sports odds, reducing manual workload and cutting client operational staff from 30 to 10, significantly improving efficiency and scalability.
